# Diamond-PetLandia
Diamond’s PetLandia is a game that will allow users to choose a pet out of four different animals. Once chosen, it will be the user’s responsibility to take care of their pet by feeding it, training, and napping it. As long as the user keeps the pet’s energy at high levels, they will be successful in the game. 

Characteristics vary from pet to pet, and some pets need more attention than others. For example, puppies get hungry faster after training than other animals and lose more energy when sleeping. On the other hand, kittens get hungrier faster when training than other animals. 

In order to beat the game, the user must make sure to not let the energy levels reach 0% and not let boredom, sleepiness, and hunger levels reach 100% and, they need to keep their pet healthy as time progresses.
